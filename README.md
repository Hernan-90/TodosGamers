# TodosGamers Challenge: React and Next.js

Welcome to TodosGamers, a project developed using React and Next.js as part of a challenge by TodosGamers. This project showcases my skills in building a dynamic web application for exploring breweries near your location, with the ability to view detailed information about each brewery with leveraging modern web technologies.

## Key Features & Technologies Used

- **React and Next.js:** Utilizing the React library and Next.js framework for building fast and scalable web applications with server-side rendering capabilities, providing a seamless user experience.
- **Axios for HTTPS Requests:** Implementing Axios, a popular JavaScript library, for making HTTPS requests to fetch data from external APIs or backend servers, enabling seamless data retrieval and management.
- **Consumption of Breweries API:** Integrating a breweries API as part of the challenge, allowing users to fetch and display information about different breweries within the application.
- **Custom CSS Styling:** Employing custom CSS styles to design and customize the user interface, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience.
- **Redux State Management:** Integrating Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, to manage application state and facilitate data flow across components, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
